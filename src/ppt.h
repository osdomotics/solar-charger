/**
 * \defgroup Peak Power Tracking Solar Charger
 *
 * This software implements Tim Nolan's Peak Power Tracking Solar
 * Charger. Originally designed with an Arduino Duemilanove Board it was
 * ported to Contiki by Ralf Schlatterbeck and rewritten in large parts.
 * The original soft- and hardware of the project is open source "free
 * of any restiction for anyone to use". I'm putting this under the
 * 3-clause BSD license (see above) to be compatible with other Contiki
 * code.
 *
 * The original author, Tim Nolan writes: "All I ask is that if you use
 * any of my hardware or software or ideas from this project is that you
 * give me credit and add a link to my website www.timnolan.com to your
 * documentation. Thank you."
