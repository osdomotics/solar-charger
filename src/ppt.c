/**
 * \brief Charger state machine
 *
 * Depending on current charger state compute new state and pwm to be
 * set. We have four states:
 *
 * CHARGER_ON: we have SOL_MILLIWATT_MIN < sol_milliwatt < SOL_MILLIWATT_LOW
 *   Probably happening at dawn or dusk when solar power is too low for
 *   bulk charging state but not low enough for off state. We set pwm to
 *   pwm_max to get the available power to the battery.
 *   When entering this state from CHARGER_OFF, we also wait CHG_WAIT
 *   until power has settled (or until power drops below
 *   SOL_MILLIWATT_RST).
 *
 * CHARGER_BULK: sol_milliwatt > SOL_MILLIWATT_LOW
 *   Bulk charging of battery running the Peak Power Tracking algorithm.
 *   We try to run the maximum amount of current into the battery.
 *
 * CHARGER_FLOAT: As the battery voltage rises up to BAT_MILLIVOLT_MAX
 *   we are done with bulk charging. We try to keep the battery voltage
 *   at BAT_MILLIVOLT_MAX by adjusting the pwm value. If we get to
 *   pwm_max it means we can't keep the battery voltage at
 *   BAT_MILLIVOLT_MAX which probably means the battery is being drawn
 *   by some load. So we need to go back to bulk charging mode.
 *
 * CHARGER_OFF: Entered when sol_milliwatt < SOL_MILLIWATT_MIN. The
 *   charger goes into this state when it gets dark and there is no more
 *   power being generated by the solar panel. The MOSFETs are turned
 *   off in this state so that power from the battery doesn't leak back
 *   into the solar panel. When this state is entered a counter is set
 *   to OFF_WAIT and decremented in each cycle. This is done because if
 *   the battery is disconnected (or a fuse is blown) it takes some time
 *   before the battery voltage changes enough so we can tell that the
 *   battery is no longer connected. Counting down from OFF_WAIT gives
 *   some time for the battery voltage to change so we can tell this.
